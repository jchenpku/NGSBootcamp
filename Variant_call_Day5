# Structural Variation (SV) analysis

# Very general workflow for variant analysis
# 1. fastq files from your sample
# 2. Run FastQC for quality control
#  2a) if qualtify of bases (in particular at the end of reads) are bad, perform trimming.
#  2b) if there are adapter sequences present in your fastq files, remove adapter sequence.
# => OK. fastq quality is good. Lets go to step 3
# 3. Perform Alignemnt using your favorite aligner (e.g., BWA, etc.) and generate SAM or BAM files.
# 4. Sort bam file and generate an index file for your bam file.
# 5. Variant calling using your favorite SV detection tool
# 6. Now we have variant calls (e.g., a list of SVs). We want to annotate them to see whether those variants are reported by someone eles or associated with known disease phenotype and/or see what would be functional impact.
#  6a) We will use snpEff tool (http://snpeff.sourceforge.net) and please read snpEff readme file (http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff.html)
# 7. Interpretation. Now we have annotated variant calls and need to make sense out of it.
# 8. It is important to visualize your bam file to double check whether variants called by computational algorithms are real(?).
# Utilmately, you want to validate your variants using Sanger or etc.
